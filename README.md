# Welcome to News InShorts App ðŸ‘‹
This app provides summarized version of news articles from different news site. 
When running this site, you might need to setup additional config for connecting to localhost. For immediate fix, I hosted on server on different route using ngrok. Add that `BASE_API_URL` to `.env` file.
The backend for this site is written in Django and available [here](https://github.com/sumann7916/news-backend).



This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).



## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
     cp env.example .env
     npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
